        <h2>Every <span id="idea">idea</span> starts with a need</h2>
        <p>
          Earlier this year (January 2018), I started to think about how I could
          improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start
          designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
          stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge,
          something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many
          designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
          really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
          something nice and did not solve any problem.

            <h3>Start with asking</h3>

            <p>
              Why? You will start seeing things differently and coming up with
              more effective ways of achieving goals.

              will be fresher and more valuable.

            <p>
              Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
              frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

              As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
              finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
              feedback and learn from it.

              It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected
              you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering
              something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close
              attention to your surroundings.

              It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these
              problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook
              and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

            <h3>Design your proposal</h3>
            <p>
              How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
              features and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget
              to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?

              you came up with the solution and how the design achieves it. Find
              out what people have to say about it.
